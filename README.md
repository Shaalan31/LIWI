Language Independent Writer Identification

Automatic offline text-independent writer identification is very important for forensic
analysis, documents authorization, and calligraphic relicâ€™s identification, etc. The offline textindependent
writer identification is to determine the writer of a text among a number of known
writers using their handwriting images. Extensive researches have been conducted in this field. In
addition, a series of international writer identification contests have been successfully organized.
In general, the existing approaches of offline text-independent writer identification can be
roughly divided into two categories: texture-based approaches and structure-based approaches.
In this project we considered three different approaches for identifying writers, a texturebased
approach, and two structure-based approach, the main aim was to compare the results and
come up with the best approach for a writer identification application, we then implemented a user
friendly interface to make it easier for the users to try out our model.
